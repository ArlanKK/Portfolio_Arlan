### ABOUT THIS PROJECT

>  CESI_X (Mai 2024 - Juin 2024)

This project involved designing a home delivery service application for food products, similar to Uber Eats. I worked on it as part of a group of four, organized into pairs with a Backend team and a Frontend team. The goal was to enhance our skills and explore new technologies, such as Node.js and React.
