### ABOUT THIS INTERNSHIP

> AFRILAND FIRST BANK (Janvier 2023 - Avril 2023)

This internship took place at the Sn-Elec headquater in Pornichet, where I had the opportunity to explore the energy sector and observe the growing impact of technological advancements. Immersed in the IT Department, I was assigned various tasks, such as:

- Diagnose and resolve a web error, particularly using the error code (404, 403, 500, 502, etc.), by initially following the established protocol.
- Set up a backup server within the company.
- Implement a backup policy.
- Deploy Dolibarr and train employees.
