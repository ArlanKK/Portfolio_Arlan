### ABOUT THIS INTERNSHIP

> GHALAN by TRUSTEAM (OCTOBRE 2023 - MARS 2024)

This internship was based at GHALAN by TRUSTEAM in Belgium. I had the opportunity to enhance my knowledge in the realm of software development, immersed in the world of Systems and Network Administrators. This allowed me to understand the challenges that IT technicians may encounter in terms of computer and system maintenance. One of the projects I was involved in was the development of a customer order management tool that enabled the IT support team to centralize, organize, and automate processes related to customer orders. A key feature of the tool was the real-time display of essential customer information directly on the techniciansâ€™ screens when a client called the service, allowing them to address concerns quickly and efficiently.

This project aimed to help the company optimize productivity and achieve a 60% increase in profits.
