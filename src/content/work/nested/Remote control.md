### ABOUT THIS PROJECT

> Project made in pairs to test our ability to interact with and manage devices and systems 

COne of the most rewarding projects I worked on during my time at Polytech Nancy. I had the opportunity to create a remote control system alongside one of my classmates, under the supervision of one of our professors. This was a year-long, tutor-guided project completed during my second year of preparatory classes. The objective was to design an entire home automation system, enabling the control of electronic devices and household systems remotely.

At the end of the year, we received a "high distinction" for this project after presenting it to a jury.

### TECHNOLOGIES USED
- Arduino (IDE and electronic components)
- App Inventor
