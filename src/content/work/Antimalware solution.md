### ABOUT THIS PROJECT

> Security is not a product, but a process.

This project involved creating a diagnostic software to protect fragile and confidential systems against external threats by detecting and eliminating malware.

However, it was not completed as planned. The software was able to detect and eliminate malware, but only the less critical ones, leaving more sophisticated threats undetected.


#### TECHNOLOGIES USED
- Python with  Spyder
